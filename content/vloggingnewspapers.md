**Note**: currently on hold due my upcoming exams. Priorities!

<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

In order to up my Japanese pronunciation and become more fluent in Japanese text recitation, I've tried getting acquainted with vlogging in Japanese. I'll (hopefully) publish weekly videos of myself narrating a newly posted news article published on one of the mainstream Japanese newspaper websites, using a classic streaming-style set-up so any potential viewer can read along.

If time permits, I've found it a fun exercise to try and translate the article as well as create subtitles (maybe I should try fan-subbing some anime or drama one of these days, if I ever find the time, that is~).

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

As this will become a weekly thing I won't be posting new blog-articles for every single video I do, but feel free to follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/PoppeStevie) or subscribe to my [YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-wW8gg1lGVn99X9ue6_eVA). For now it's limited to these narrations and (*wip*) music, but actually I've always wanted to try actual vlogging and/or podcasts.... Maybe it'll happen one day (when I'm studying abroadかな～).

As usual I've added subtitles in CC. *(30/10/16)* (not sure if that's a bad angle or if I should really lose some weight soon...)

## Week 2: {{くまモン}}

My second vlog is a bit more light-hearted and covers the history of the famous Kumamoto Prefecture character **Kumamon**, again covered in an *Asahi Shimbun* article: [くまモン、やせていた「過去」　失敗糧にキャラ再設定](http://digital.asahi.com/articles/ASJ9Y3K05J9YTLVB00F.html).

## Week 1: {{ブラック企業}}

My first vlog is on the ブラック{{企業(きぎょう)}}, the so-called Japanese **[Black companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_company_(Japanese_term))**. I'm reading the *Asahi Shimbun* article [ブラック企業、見抜くには…転職者から情報、離職率調査](http://digital.asahi.com/articles/ASJBG5DH5JBGUTIL03S.html) and attempted my own translation as seen in the subtitles (I've added them as soft-subs in YouTube, so you can (de)activate them at will).[^1] *(16/10/16)*
