    <Attribute name="title">A Quick Guide on Using Anki (effectively) (in an academic context)</Attribute>
    <Attribute name="author">Stevie Poppe</Attribute>
    <Attribute name="description">Those who know me might accuse me of preaching the memorization tool Anki as the best thing that’s ever happened to studying, and they wouldn’t be that far off. Over the past year I’ve extensively integrated this software in my studies, with (to me personally) remarkable results in both productivity and academic grades. There are however, some pitfalls for the casual user to take heed of, and getting the full benefit of your time requires cultivating a proper mindset. As I mention Anki a great deal on this site, I decided on writing my own short guide on setting up and using Anki as well as describe how I personally integrate it into my studies. Anyone with an interest in studying Japanese will surely already have heard of Anki. It’s covered extensively on all the major learning resources online, and the canonical self learner’s beginner path seems to be Heisig’s Kanji method, Tae Kim’s online Grammar Guide and Core 2K/6K/10K, all three accompanied by Anki. Language acquisition certainly remains Anki’s most popular usage, but lately, the software’s become broad enough to find it’s way in various other branches (it’s become an integrated routine for medical students, for example, as well as math students thanks to LaTeX support). So far this sounds like I’m paid to advertise Anki. Except the software’s free and open source, and if you don’t like synchronizing your anki progress over Anki’s servers you could even set that up on your own as well. What is Anki? Why is Anki?! How is Anki?!? Pretty good, thank you. You’d have guessed it by now: Anki is an extremely customizable application designed for memorization, available for free on nearly all the major platforms as well as being accessable online. Being able to study on the road (I commute by train, taking me up to 3 hours total traveling time every day) and synchronizing your progress at home is a major boon on using your time practically. There are plenty of studies on methods for efficient learning, and unsurprisingly, classic late-night cramming, and passive studying methods as extensive marking and rereading of texts don’t score very high. On the other hand, active recall testing (questioning yourself by actively trying to come up with the answer to a question) and spaced learning (spreading information absorption over long periods of time) are concidered key. Anki is an application that achieves both through the means of timed flashcards. The concept is simple: the front of the card asks you a question and the backside displays the answer. After showing the answer, you decide whether you got it wrong or right, and to what degree. This determines when you’ll be confronted by this card again. The Guide Setting up!

<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
<p>Those who know me might accuse me of preaching the memorization tool <strong>Anki</strong> as the best thing that’s ever happened to studying, and they wouldn’t be that far off. Over the past year I’ve extensively integrated this software in my studies, with (to me personally) remarkable results in both productivity and academic grades. There are however, some pitfalls for the casual user to take heed of, and getting the full benefit of your time requires cultivating a proper mindset. As I mention Anki a great deal on this site, I decided on writing my own <del><em>short</em></del> guide on setting up and using Anki as well as describe how I personally integrate it into my studies.</p>

It’s covered extensively on all the major learning resources online, and the canonical self learner’s beginner path seems to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi#Heisig.27s_method">Heisig’s Kanji method</a>, Tae Kim’s online <a href="http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar">Grammar Guide</a> and Core 2K/6K/10K<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, all three accompanied by Anki. Language acquisition certainly remains Anki’s most popular usage, but lately, the software’s become broad enough to find it’s way in various other branches (it’s become an integrated routine for medical students, for example, as well as math students thanks to LaTeX support).

<h1 id="what-is-anki-why-is-anki-how-is-anki"><em>What</em> is Anki? <em>Why</em> is Anki?! <em>How</em> is Anki?!?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Pretty good, thank you.</em></p>

<p>You’d have guessed it by now: Anki is an extremely customizable application designed for memorization, available for free on nearly all the major platforms<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> as well as being accessable online. Being able to study on the road (I commute by train, taking me up to 3 hours total traveling time every day) and synchronizing your progress at home is a major boon on using your time practically.</p>
<p>There are plenty of studies on methods for efficient learning, and unsurprisingly, classic late-night cramming, and passive studying methods as extensive marking and rereading of texts don’t score very high. On the other hand, <code><em>active recall testing</em></code> (questioning yourself by actively trying to come up with the answer to a question) and <code><em>spaced learning</em></code> (spreading information absorption over long periods of time) are concidered key<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Anki is an application that achieves both through the means of timed flashcards. The concept is simple: the front of the card asks you a question and the backside displays the answer. After showing the answer, <em>you</em> decide whether you got it wrong or right, and to what degree. This determines when you’ll be confronted by this card again.</p>
<h1 id="the-guide">The Guide</h1>
<h2 id="setting-up">Setting up!</h2>
<h3 id="download-install">Download &amp; Install</h3>
<p class="center"><img alt="center" src="https://steviepoppe.net/images/anki/anki-download.png" style="width: 274px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>Download the application for whatever system you like on <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki’s homepage</a> and just follow the installer’s steps. I highly recommend purchasing a lower-end smartphone if you’re still using a brick as cellphone. It’s somewhat of a steep investment, but worth it in the long run (not just for Anki but plenty of other learning tools such as dictionaries or OCR tools<sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>).</p>
<h3 id="account-syncing">Account &amp; Syncing</h3>
<p>To be able to syncronize your progress over different devices you’ll have to register an account at Anki’s <a href="https://ankiweb.net/account/register">web service</a> (I definitely encourage doing this regardless: just imagine the horror if your device breaks down after 3 years of having intensively studied flashcards).</p>
<p class="center border"><img alt="center border" src="https://steviepoppe.net/images/anki/ankiweb-reg.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>In your desktop Anki, open <strong>Settings</strong> -&gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> from the menu, then select the <strong>Network</strong> tab and insert your user credidentials. From the Anki’s main menu, select the <em>syncing</em> icon to try it out.</p>
<p>Now do the same on your mobile device. On Ankidroid this is <strong>Settings</strong> -&gt; <strong>AnkiDroid</strong> -&gt; <strong>AnkiWeb Account</strong>. Make sure the “<strong>Download Media</strong>” option below “<strong>Synchronize</strong>” is tagged!</p>
<p>Now try syncing from this device as well. If everything goes well, we’ll start with our first set.</p>
<p class="center border"><img alt="center border" src="https://steviepoppe.net/images/anki/ankipc-sync.jpg" style="width: 370px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/></p>
<h2 id="creating-your-first-set-and-cards">Creating your first set and cards!</h2>
<p>How to create a simple set and add some cards</p>
<h3 id="your-first-set-efficiently">Your first set…  <em>Efficiently</em>!</h3>
<p>If you’re starting on a new language, you’ll probably start by learning basic vocabulary common in every language (eg. words such as “person”, “name”, etc). You should probably look for premade decks and eventually adjust the card lay-out to your own liking. No need to re-invent the wheel, after all. Anki’s own <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/">shared deck repository</a> is a good place to start.</p>
<p>Another solution would be to work with premade word lists and import these. (write about CSV here)</p>
<p>Personally, I’ve set up my environment to import any new Japanese word I encounter online into anki, with audio and dictionary definitions.</p>
<h3 id="creating-your-own-cards-efficiently">Creating your own cards… <em>Efficiently</em>!</h3>
<p>Using premade decks is great and all but as mentioned above, at some point you’ll have to create your own to make any further progress.</p>
<p>Card templates (recognition, reproduction, audio), layouting, fonts, using furigana, etc</p>
<h2 id="structuring-data">Structuring Data</h2>
<ul>
<li>“<em>But Stevie</em>”, I hear you ask, “<em>how do I study less structured information with Anki?</em>“</li>
</ul>
<p>Good question. This involves some thinking on your part: what is it that you’d like to reproduce? What information would you like to memorize? Think creatively on your course and in what different ways you could structure it in bite-sized pieces to feed your ankiset<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. Courses are designed with a certain logic in mind, after all. You could start off by making subsets on each of the big chapters of your textbook, or create the answer to potential questions first, mark the important data next, and ankify<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> this. This processing is <strong>an important step in grasping the big picture</strong> and <strong>part of the actual studying</strong>. This is the exact reason why I’m reluctant to share some of my own sets that don’t involve the need for just rote memorization.</p>
<p>Over the past two years at university I’ve devised and adjusted my own method to structuring and creating ankisets. Feel free to try it yourself (your mileage might vary). It goes somewhat as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Structure</strong>: create a structure based on the course’s one (this could be as simple as copying the Table of Contents) or on repeating elements (certain theories, models, periods in time, artists, their works, etc). If the content of a single class is relatively self-containing, this is even easier. Use this as template for your set.</li>
<li><strong>Analyse</strong>: analyse all your available sources: your textbook, own notes, powerpoint presentations, etc. Find repeating elements, highlighted or marked parts, and everything that strikes as important. There’s a reason for this and these should be given priority on memorization.</li>
<li><strong>Devide</strong>: try to devide and rephrase these into flashcard suitable questions. Use the <em>Five Ws</em><sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> as guideline if stuck (What, Who, When, Where, Why). Try to remain brief in the backside of the flashcard: I often break this rule myself, but, if you have to scroll down, it’s usually too long.</li>
<li><strong>Style</strong>: Different information requires different styling. Alter your templates and note types to reflect these by using graphical elements, cloze-encounter, audio, different directions, etc. A simple example: to memorize important dates, I use a card with three fields (Year, Event, Information) and generate two notes on these: one displaying the year in front, one displaying the event. Both show further details on the back.</li>
<li><strong>Study</strong>: You’ve analyzed the contents. Congratulations. Get started on these new cards.</li>
</ol>
<p>If I studied something marketing-oriented I’d probably call this the <code><strong>SADSS</strong>-model</code> and write an e-book called “<strong>5 Steps To Master All Knowledge (and make you a succesful and better person along the road)</strong>”, free of charge if you subscribe to my non-existent newsletters. If I were a social media marketeer I’d add “<em>Number 5 will shock you!</em>” as subtitle. (Don’t worry. I won’t do either.)</p>
<h2 id="spaced-learning11">Spaced Learning<sup id="fnref:11"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></h2>
<ul>
<li>“<em>Stevie! If I’m a college student studying one, or several, language(s) alongside other theoretical classes (and I most likely am since I’m reading this blog), won’t this mean I get to repeat hundreds to thousands of cards every single day?!</em>“</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes. Yes it does mean that.</p>
<p>Think of it this way. You’ll have to study either way. Language acquisition comes with it’s sacrifices: you can’t just stop studying for a few weeks and expect to come out unharmed. Building up an internal dictionary containing tens of thousands of words you recognize on sight or produce actively, utilizing grammatical structures on the spot (often under severe pressure), or comprehending speech at real-time; all of these require an effort not just to memorize but to maintain as well. Same goes for any other class, you can’t cram your way through university. What this method offers is a way of structuring your data and studying efficiently: paradoxically by studying <em>more</em> you’ll actually <em>save</em> time, as there’s no need to repeat what you already know. If you’re utilizing Spaced Repetition, the data you need to know will be served (roughly) the moment you’re about to forget it.</p>
<ul>
<li>“<em>Even if I’m on a holiday? This makes me very sad! :( I’ll just pretend this method of studying is not suitable for me and dismiss anki forever!</em>“</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, this does mean maintaining your cards even when you’d prefer spending your day in a different way. There’s no pause button to put your cards on hold, so if you fail to go through them several days in row, you’ll have piled up all those lost days and take forever to get through them again.</p>
<p>Of course, once the set has finished it’s purpose (usually preparing for an exam), you could just as well delete it. It does feel as a waste (after all, what’s the point of studying in the first place?), but sadly it’s just unsustainable to maintain <em>everything</em>, all of this deep knowledge, till the end of times. Another approach here would be to suspend the more trivial cards and just stick on the broad outlines. <em>The choice lies in your own hands!</em>™
I spent about a month on a road trip in the USA this summer; unforgettable memories aside I <em>did</em> maintain my Ankisets the whole time. But as I removed all of my non-Japanese sets and maintained the <a href="https://youtu.be/9ogQ0uge06o">bare necessities</a> of vocab and kanji, this meant only about half an hour of studying each day. That’s not too bad, huh?</p>
<p>Anyway. As I’ve said earlier, you’ll have to study either way. It is entirely possible that the way Anki and it’s spaced repetition work don’t work for you, <strong>but don’t lie to yourself either</strong>.<sup id="fnref:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> Find another way that <em>does</em> work for you. There are plenty of studying methods that could be suitable, including some interesting new ones<sup id="fnref:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> gaining popularity, but more likely as not, reading and marking your textbook a few times and cramming a summary the night before an exam is not one of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>“<em>But wait Stevie hold up, if I get this right, I’ll be forced to use Anki, like, forever? Won’t I ever be able to just quit and bask in my new-found fluency?</em>“</li>
</ul>
<p>This one’s a bit difficult. I’ve heard of people using Anki <strong>for over 8 years</strong>, applying it solely as a language maintenance tool and only very occasionally adding new vocab cards when appropriate. This rings more true to me. Spaced learning means they’re only getting like 5 - 10 mins worth of repeating old cards by now anyway so why not? If there’s ever a time, however, when you’re comfortable enough to process media as-is, and you feel you’ve been a slave to software for far too long, don’t let me stop you uninstalling Anki and breaking out in some form of freedom dance. Just… don’t let all that progress go to waste! Maintain your language skills!</p>
<h1 id="wait-there-is-more">Wait! There is more!</h1>
<p>The main goal of this post was to introduce Anki both in it’s core usage as well as the wide range of appliances in the field of both linguistic and academic studies. If you’ve any further questions, feel free to leave a comment below.</p>
<p>That being said, Anki is customizable to the point books have been written on it. Thus trying to contain everything in a single post (hence “<strong>A <del>quick</del> guide to Anki</strong>”) is a mission impossible. There are several other features I feel are useful (and underrepresented) enough in mainstream language blogs to warrant further writing though (namely Anki’s API, statistics, useful plug-ins, and integrating Rikaisama and J-pod101’s audio). Check these out in my next blogs:</p>
