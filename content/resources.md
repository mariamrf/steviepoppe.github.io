<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
This page contains links and files that have proven to be particularly useful for myself and might be of use for those with similar interests. I’ll update this spot as I encounter more tools or pages I feel are worthy of mention.

[TOC]

#Useful Links

## General

* **[Anki](http://ankisrs.net/)**: Free, open-source, multi-platform flashcard application with powerful SRS[^1] algorithm. Especially vital for language acquisition and probably the single most important (digital) tool for efficient memorization.

##Language

### Japanese

* **[Yomichan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/)**: a Firefox and Chrome pop-up dictionary and a digital-minded Japanese learner's best friend. Yomichan allows additional audio playback and full Anki integration. I've written a [blog](https://steviepoppe.net/blog/2019/04/a-quick-guide-on-using-anki-5-an-efficient-vocab-mining-set-up-with-anki-and-rikaisama-yomichan/) on how to do this. **[Rikaisama](https://steviepoppe.net/blog/2016/09/a-quick-guide-on-using-anki-2-an-efficient-vocab-mining-set-up-with-anki-and-rikaisama/)**, although no longer by Firefox, also continues to be useful for mass-generating cards while reading HTML-formatted e-books.
* **[Animelon](http://animelon.com/)**: for all you 'learn Japanese through Anime' kids out there! Reminiscent of the classic *[Erin's Challenge](https://www.erin.ne.jp/en/)* videos: watch various popular anime with Japanese subtitles and integrated dictionary. Works in combination with Yomichan or Rikaisama as well.
* **[Tangorin](http://tangorin.com/kanji/)**: my favorite online Japanese dictionary with tons of example sentences for each definition, and an excellent Kanji dictionary as well. [Goo](http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp), [Weblio](http://www.weblio.jp) and [Sanseido](http://www.sanseido.net) provide good alternatives.
* **[Waran Jiten](http://japansnederlandswoordenboek.org/index.php/Hoofdpagina)**: a Japanese-Dutch dictionary courtesy of Leuven University. Has a dutch Rikai addon.
* **[Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/directory/home-education/edlanguage/os:windows/?q=Japanese)**: contains a wide variety of software developed by fellow Japanese learners. Some, such as *[Jnovelformatter](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jnovelformatter/?source=directory)*, *[Japanese Text Analysis Tool](https://sourceforge.net/projects/japanesetextana/?source=directory)* or *[OCR Manga Reader](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ocrmangareaderforandroid/)* are particularly noteworthy, others not so much.
* **[KULeuven Japanology](http://japanologie.arts.kuleuven.be/)**: the Leuven University Japan Studies homepage. <i class="icon-smile"></i>

###Korean

* **[Toktogi](http://www.toktogi.com/)**: a Korean-English pop-up dictionary similar to yomichan, available both for Firefox and Chrome. It's still a work-in-progress and not as polished as Yomichan, but very usable nonetheless.
* **[Naver Dictionary](http://endic.naver.com/?sLn=en)**: Naver Corporation, the highly popular South Korean web-hub, has a fairly complete English-Korean dictionary as well as an Android application (requires internet).

###Sanskrit

* **[spokensanskrit](http://spokensanskrit.de/)**: the only decent online Sanskrit dictionary out there.
* **[Lexilogos](http://www.lexilogos.com/keyboard/sanskrit_devanagari.htm)**: multilingual web keyboard that beats learning to type *devanagari* on a latin-script keyboard.

# Files

## Anki

I use Anki to complement my other study methods for nearly all my classes. These are a bunch of Anki-sets I made I feel are stand-alone enough to be useful to new students of these classes as well.

### Inleiding tot de Europese Literatuur na 1750

* **Download**: [Europese Literatuur <i class="icon-download-alt"></i>](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yf2hdqxyqobqr60/Europese_Literatuur.apkg?dl=0)  (±26MB)

A full set to accompany the textbook '*Literaire Verbeelding 2*':[^3] contains important dates and summaries of all artists and their discussed works (in Dutch), sorted by period (from Romanticism till Post-modernism).

### Kanji 1 & Kanji 2

* **Download**: [Kanji 1 <i class="icon-download-alt"></i>](https://www.dropbox.com/s/83w2rsrack9ohs0/Kanji_1.apkg?dl=0) [Kanji Vocab 1 <i class="icon-download-alt"></i>](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2885777i70qfr15/Kanji_woordenschat_1.apkg?dl=0) (±9MB each)

Two sets on the compulsory Kanji and vocabulary as seen in the Kanji classes in the first year of Japan Studies at KU Leuven. They contain stroke order, definitions, and different readings, both in recognition and reproduction form. They use the *KanjiStrokeOrders*[^4] font and display hidden *hiragana* on touch/hover. I recommend doing these on a hand-held device to practice writing and stroke order using the touchscreen.

* **Download**: [Kanji 2 <i class="icon-download-alt"></i>](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3hvl2unaghb375l/Kanji_2.apkg?dl=0) [Kanji Vocab 2 <i class="icon-download-alt"></i>](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x4dlldq95x3x8rj/Kanji_woordenschat_2.apkg?dl=0) (±10MB each)

Similar to the previous decks, two sets on the compulsory kanji and vocabulary for Kanji/goi classes in the second year of Japanese Studies, as seen in our handbook[^5] lessons 1 - 20. They're tagged by chapter and contain respectively stroke order, radicals, definitions, and different readings for the Kanji set, and example sentences in *cloze deletion*[^6] for vocab, both in recognition and reproduction form.

Includes an introduction to the Devanagari alphabet, a recap of the taught grammar points (such as different conjugations and Sandi rules), three-way cards (English/Sanskrit, Sanskrit/English and audio) of all the vocabulary as seen in class and several exercises.

### Anki Plug-in: Japanese Definitions for Korean Vocabulary

* **Download**: [Japanese Definitions for Korean Vocabulary <i class="icon-download-alt"></i>](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/553926167)

An Anki add-on, based on the [Sanseido Definitions](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1967553085) add-on, for adding Japanese translations of Korean vocabulary. It's primarily meant for Korean learners who're proficient in, or simultaneously learning, Japanese. I wrote a [small tutorial](https://steviepoppe.net/blog/2016/10/anki-add-on-japanese-translations-for-korean-vocabulary/) for those new to Anki plug-ins.

### Anki Plug-in: Remove Missing Audio References

* **Download**: [Remove Missing Audio References <i class="icon-download-alt"></i>](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1328067109)

An Anki plug-in to be used in combination with a Rikaisama / Anki set-up as prescribed in [this blog](https://steviepoppe.net/blog/2016/09/a-quick-guide-on-using-anki-2-an-efficient-vocab-mining-set-up-with-anki-and-rikaisama/). Replaces or removes references to missing audio-files.
