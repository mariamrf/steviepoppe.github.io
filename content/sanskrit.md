After nearly two years of intensely studying Japanese, I took on Sanskrit, an optional course at our university, both as hobby and as means of testing my language acquisition skills.

One of the main reasons why I took Sanskrit was to 
efficient studying (common theme in my posts, hey don't blame me, too little time, too many hobbies)

language learning: sounds formed in mouth, easing, etc
