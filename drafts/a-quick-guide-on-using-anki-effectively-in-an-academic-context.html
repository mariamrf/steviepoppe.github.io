    <Attribute name="author">Stevie Poppe</Attribute>
    <Attribute name="description">Those who know me might accuse me of preaching the memorisation tool Anki as the best thing that’s ever happened to studying, and they wouldn’t be that far of. Over the past year I’ve extensively integrated this software in my studies, with remarkable results in both productivity and academic grades. There are however, some pitfalls for the casual user to take heed of, and getting the full benefit of your time requires cultivating a proper mindset. As I talk extensively about Anki - and it’s usage in various situations - on this site, I decided on writing my own short guide on setting up and using Anki, as well as how I integrate it into my studies myself. Anyone with an interest in studying Japanese will surely already have heard of Anki. It’s covered extensively on all the major learning resources online, and the canonical self learner’s beginner path seems to be Heisig’s Kanji method, Tae Kim’s online Grammar Guide and Core 2K/6K/10K, all three accompanied by Anki. Surely, language acquisition remains it’s primary function, but lately, the software’s also become an integrated routine for medical students and finding it’s way in various other branches. This whole post sounds like I’m paid to advertise Anki. Except the software’s free and open source, and if you don’t like syncing your anki progress over Anki’s servers, you can just as well set up your own. What is Anki? Why is Anki?! How is Anki?!? Pretty good, thank you. You’d have guessed it by now: Anki is an extremely customizable application designed for memorisation, available for free on nearly all the major platforms as well as being accessable online. Being able to study on the road (I commute by train, taking me approximately 2.5u every day) and syncing your progress at home is a major boon on using your time practically. There are plenty of studies on methods for efficient learning, and most put the popular late-night cramming, extensive marking and rereading of texts at the top bottom. On the other hand, active recall testing (actively trying to come up with the answer to a question) and spaced learning (spreading information absorbtion over long periods) are always placed at the very top. Anki is an application that achieves both through the means of timed flashcards. The concept is simple: the front of the card asks you a question and the backside displays the answer. After showing the answer, you decide whether you got it wrong or right, and to what degree. This determines when you’ll be confronted by this card again. The Guide Setting up!

        <!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
<p>Those who know me might accuse me of preaching the memorisation tool Anki as the best thing that’s ever happened to studying, and they wouldn’t be <em>that</em> far of. Over the past year I’ve extensively integrated this software in my studies, with remarkable results in both productivity and academic grades. There are however, some pitfalls for the casual user to take heed of, and getting the full benefit of your time requires cultivating a proper mindset. As I talk extensively about Anki - and it’s usage in various situations - on this site, I decided on writing my own short guide on setting up and using Anki, as well as how I integrate it into my studies myself.</p>

<ul>
<li>“<em>But Stevie</em>”, I hear you ask, “<em>how do I study less structured information with Anki?</em>“</li>
</ul>
<p>Good question. This involves some thinking on your part: what is it that you’d like to reproduce? What information would you like to memorise? Think creatively on your course and in what different ways you could structure it in bitesized pieces to feed your ankiset.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Courses are designed with a certain logic in mind, after all. You could start off by making subsets on each of the big chapters of your textbook, or create the answer to potential questions first, mark the important data next, and ankify<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> this. This processing is <strong>an important step in grasping the big picture</strong> and <strong>part of the actual studying</strong>. This is the exact reason why I’m reluctant to share some of my own sets that don’t involve the need for just rote memorisation.</p>
<p>I’ve adjusted my own method to structuring over the years. it goes somewhat as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analyse</strong>: blabla</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Structure</strong>: blabla</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Devide</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>blabla</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Study</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spaced-learning">Spaced Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>“<em>Stevie! If I’m a college student studying one, or several, language(s) alongside other theoretical classes (and I most likely am since I’m reading this blog), won’t this mean I get to repeat hundreds to thousands of cards every single day?!</em>“</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes. Yes it does mean that.</p>
<p>Think of it this way. You’ll have to study either way. Language acquisition comes with it’s sacrifices: you can’t just stop studying for a few weeks and expect to come out unharmed. Building up an internal dictionary containing tens of thousands of words you recognize on sight or produce actively, utilizing grammatical structures on the spot (often under severe pressure), or comprehending speech at real-time; all of these require an effort not just to memorise but to maintain as well. Same goes for any other class, you can’t cram your way through University. What this method offers is a way of structuring your data and studying efficiently: paradoxically by studying <em>more</em> you’ll actually <em>save</em> time, as there’s no need to repeat what you already know. If you’re utilizing Spaced Repetition, the data you need to know will be served (roughly) the moment you’re about to forget it.</p>
<ul>
<li>“<em>Even if I’m on a holiday? This makes me very sad! :( I’ll just pretend this method of studying is not suitable for me and dismiss anki forever!</em>“</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, this does mean maintaining your cards even when you’d prefer spending your day in a different way. There’s no pause button to put your cards on hold, so if you fail to go through them several days in row, you’ll have piled up all those lost days and take forever to get through them again.</p>
<p>Of course, once the set has finished it’s purpose (usually preparing for an exam), you could just as well delete it. It does feel as a waste (after all, what’s the point of studying in the first place?), but sadly it’s just unsustainable to maintain <em>everything</em>, all of this deep knowledge, till the end of times. Another approach here would be to suspend the more trivial cards and just stick on the broad outlines. <em>The choice lies in your own hands!</em>™
I spent about a month on a road trip in the USA this summer; unforgettable memories aside I <em>did</em> maintain my Ankisets the whole time. But as I removed all of my non-Japanese sets and maintained the bare necessities of vocab and kanji, this meant only about an hour of studying each day. Not too bad, ay?</p>
<p>Anyway. As I’ve said earlier, you’ll have to study either way. It is entirely possible that the way Anki and it’s spaced repetition work don’t work for you, <strong>but don’t lie to yourself either</strong>. Find another way that <em>does</em> work for you. There are plenty of studying methods that could be suitable, including some <a href="#">interesting new ones</a> gaining popularity, but more likely as not, reading and marking your textbook a few times and cramming a summary the night before an exam is not one of them.</p>
