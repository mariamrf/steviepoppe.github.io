&lt;p&gt;Footnotes are a classic staple in any writer’s toolbox and allows them to, in an unobtrusive way, citate sources or display additional information not directly related to the original argument. Yet I feel online footnotes, through the way they’re often implemented imitating printed media footnotes, come over quite counterintuitive by forcing the interested reader to disrupt his reading flow, and by failing to make use of today’s extensive webdesign posibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I royally use footnotes in my markdown writing workflow&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I figured I’d get acquainted with the Pelican documentation a bit and write a small unobtrusive CSS pop-up plugin to display these on hover for those devices that support it.&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A long summer break allowed me enough free time to sit down and get started on the technicalities; a process a bit more complicated as initially expected but worth it in the long run. This blog serves not as a tutorial on making one with Pelican (I’ll get to that eventually), but as a brief log on my reasoning and thought process during creation.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Stevie Poppe</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:steviepoppe.net,2016-08-23:blog/2016/08/hello-world-about-this-blog/</guid><category>pelican</category><category>blog</category><category>github</category></item></channel></rss>
